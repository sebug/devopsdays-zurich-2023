## Building High-Performing Teams through Psychological Safety
95% of the employees feel that their wings are pinned (like the expression)

Disagreement doesn't have to be conflict.

Manual of Me

Tip for smaller teams: Rely on structured feedback, not just the coffe break talk.

## Reporting on Reliability
@rmedranollamas

 - What the hell? &lt;- Incident status
 - What was that? &lt;- Postmortem
 - How's it going? &lt; Periodic Reviews

### What the hell
Real-time incident management. Don't phone. Live docs.

### What was that?
Postmortem. Make it blameless.

Action items - track, and the incident is not really over until all the action items are completed.

### How's it going?
How is the team doing? (Toil). Forecast demand. Forecast work to be done.
