## Building High-Performing Teams through Psychological Safety
95% of the employees feel that their wings are pinned (like the expression)

Disagreement doesn't have to be conflict.

Manual of Me

Tip for smaller teams: Rely on structured feedback, not just the coffe break talk.

## Reporting on Reliability
@rmedranollamas

 - What the hell? &lt;- Incident status
 - What was that? &lt;- Postmortem
 - How's it going? &lt; Periodic Reviews

### What the hell
Real-time incident management. Don't phone. Live docs.

### What was that?
Postmortem. Make it blameless.

Action items - track, and the incident is not really over until all the action items are completed.

### How's it going?
How is the team doing? (Toil). Forecast demand. Forecast work to be done.

Do we name names? Yes, but the blameless part is really "so what".

## From Backend Developer to DevOps
@Ladymeyy

Documentation - write How to's

Advantage of teaching early on - you still have fresh eyes for the stuff other people already forgot.

Before: stupid

goal: expertise-driven

Adjust privileges to expertise

Dashboards *that actually make sense* - pointing to actual stuff that happens in the application.

Example: IP logs - that doesn't even, like, make sense, in a container-based world.
